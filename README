A frontend for ffmpeg using only pipes, not under GPL, but under BSD license.

Features:
  - get ffmpeg's infomation (versions,codecs,formats,pix_fmts,...)
  - read frames from a video
  - write a video within post frames in Python

You can install and test pipeffmpeg as follows:

	1. download libav(ffmpeg) binary or source and build that
	   (not necessary as shared-library).

	2. set bin/ffmpeg or ffmpeg.exe(under Windows) into PATH environment

	3. download pipeffmpeg.py to your current directory or site-packages
